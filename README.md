# SplitLohmannVRCode

This repository demonstrates the computation needed to display 3D scenes in Split-Lohmann Display.

`Python` version is in folder `compute_static_python`. This pipeline demonstrates the computation we do for 1 static scene. The code to control the OLED and SLM displays is not included.

`C++` version is in folder `compute_stream_cpp`. This pipeline demonstrates the computation we do for live videos. This program includes the control of the two displays, the OLED and the SLM.
